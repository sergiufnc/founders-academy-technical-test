# Founders Academy Technical Test

Founders Academy has decided to pivot from reimagining business education for
the future of work and society and instead open a supermarket selling only
three products:

| Product code | Name        | Price  |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------ |
| LB1          | Light bulb  | £3.11  |
| CS1          | Chess set   | £5.00  |
| HP1          | House plant | £11.23 |

Our CEO is a fan of light bulbs and wants to offer a buy-one-get-one-free
discount to anyone purchasing them.

Our COO wants to drive sales of chess sets by offering a bulk discount to any
customer buying three or more, reducing the price to £4.50.

We’d like you to build a checkout in React with a button for each product,
allowing users to add multiple items to their cart and see their total
(including any discounts) in real time.

The items can be added in any order and, as our CEO and COO change their minds
often, the checkout needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules.

The look and feel of the checkout isn’t important at this stage: we care more
about getting the business logic right. We’ve provided this skeleton
application to get you started but please feel free to make any changes you see
fit.

To test your checkout, here are some sample test cases:

| Cart contents           | Expected total |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| LB1, LB1                | £3.11          |
| CS1, CS1, LB1, CS1      | £16.61         |
| LB1, CS1, LB1, LB1, HP1 | £22.45         |

We only expect you to spend up to 2 hours on this exercise and please don’t
worry if you run out of time. If you do not complete it, please make sure the
code you send runs and add a note to your solution letting us know what remains
to be implemented.
